# Let's give this AI a test drive

Artificial Intelligence has always been such a fascinating subject to philosophize and talk about, quite befitting as a first post topic too.

One of the things people talk about that catches my attention the most is the fear that surrounds it. There are a substantial amount of influential tech bawlers that consider this matter to be a very serious one. Some go the extra mile to spread their views and one could even argue that [OpenAI][0] spawned from these very efforts.

There is one aspect of this view that people are missing though, all of us filter the world based on our own experience of reality. That is a fancy way of saying that you will always project the limitations of your view to the outside world. So basically, if I see intelligence as something more that just compiling data, while considering AI may may surpass such limited view, then artificial intelligence represents the potential of  a remarkably beautiful future.

A lot of the people around this subject arrive to the conjecture that machines will see humans as a threat, as a source of destruction that must  be dealt with. If you look closely though, this perception is particularly interesting because, on one hand, these people identify humanity as a destructive force (including themselves). That begs the question of why would they remain doing the same "human" things then? On the other hand, this utilitarian and reductive perception of people as just consumers of planetary resources may be simplistic at best. 

One of the most arrogant human perception is that we are _just_ living on this a planet. An alternative view is that this planet may be a living entity and we are organisms that not only inhabit it, but conform it, similar to cells. If we take that perception a bit further and consider we're the only beings on this planet that have shown evident signs of objectifying intelligence (literally) in order to gather it and share with each other, then it stands to reason that we may be acting neurons of a planetary brain.

In fact this objectification has taken shape of a physical neural network we call the internet, where we individual neurons retain a very specific way of perceiving the universe and then link that perception with others via blogs, facebook posts, periscopes and the like.
