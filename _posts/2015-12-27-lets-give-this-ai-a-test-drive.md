# Let's give this AI a test drive

Artificial Intelligence has always been such a fascinating subject to philosophize and talk about, quite befitting as a first post topic too.

One of the things people talk about that catches my attention the most is the fear that surrounds it. There are a substantial amount of influential tech bawlers that consider this matter to be a very serious one. Some go the extra mile to spread their views and one could even argue that [OpenAI][0] spawned from these very efforts.

There is one aspect of this view that people are missing though, all of us filter the world based on our own experience of reality. That is a fancy way of saying that you will always project the limitations of your view to the outside world. So basically, if I see intelligence as something that transcends a compilation of data, and believe that AI may may surpass such limited view, then artificial intelligence represents the potential of a beautiful future.

A lot of the people around the subject arrive to the conjecture that machines will see humans as a source of destruction and thus need to be dealt with. If you look closely this perception is super interesting because, on one hand, these people identify humanity as a destructive force including themselves and that begs the question of why would they remain doing the same human things. On the other hand, this utilitarian and reductive perception of people as just consumers of planetary resources may be simplistic at best. 

One of the biggest arrogant views of humans is the perception that we're just living on this a planet. An alternative view to this is that this planet may be a living entity and we are organisms that are part of it, similar to cells. If we take that perception a bit further and consider we're the only beings on this planet that have shown evident signs of objectifying  intellect for the means of gathering and sharing it, so we may be neurons.

In fact this objectification has taken shape of a physical neural network we call the internet where we individual neurons retain a very specific way of perceiving the universe and then link that perception with others via text, pictures or videos.
